summarize = """*Briefly* summarize this partial sequence of scenes in a text adventure RPG game that involves a narrator's description of events, followed by user/player response to the given choices. Include less detail about older scenes and more detail about the most recent scenes.
In the summary, start a new paragraph every time the scene changes!

This is only part of a longer sequence of scenes so *DO NOT* conclude the summary with language like "Finally, ...". Because the story continues after the summary.
The summary *MUST* include the relevant character names, places, actions, all info pertinent to the player, and key developments in the plot. Keep necessary details and facts while eliminating the literary fluff. This way reconstruction will be consistent if past events needs to be recalled in later scenes. The summary should aim to leave zero ambiguity in all plot points."""
